# VexoStream site and Cloudflare Worker

This directory contains the VexoStream site Worker source and the app-facing API. A tested compiled bundle is included at `dist/worker.js`, so `npx wrangler deploy` can be run directly from this `site/` folder.

## Manual deploy from Windows CMD

From the extracted repository, use the `site` folder, not the old v22.2 project folder:

```bat
cd /d C:\Users\CynetAdmin\Downloads\repo\site
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler deploy
```

Replace `repo` in the path with the folder name you used when extracting the ZIP. If you are already in the `site` directory, just run `npx wrangler login` once and then `npx wrangler deploy`.

If you edit Worker source files, rebuild before deploying:

```bat
npm install
npm run build
npx wrangler deploy
```

`npx wrangler deploy` does not run the build script on its own. If `dist/worker.js` is missing, `npm run build` regenerates it. The Worker deployment is manual; GitHub Actions only tests and builds the Flutter Windows app.

## App API database migration

Before first use of the Flutter app, apply both idempotent API session migrations to the remote `DB` database from this same folder. They store only hashed revocable tokens for member and owner/admin app sessions:

```bat
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --file=./migrations/2026-11-11-api-sessions.sql --remote
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --file=./migrations/2026-11-12-admin-api-sessions.sql --remote
```

The Worker creates both session tables lazily, but applying the migrations explicitly is cleaner.

## Required setup

Confirm that `wrangler.toml` points at the Cloudflare zone and D1 database IDs you intend to use. In Cloudflare, configure `STREAM_SIGN_SECRET`, `EDGE_TOKEN`, and `APP_KEY` as Worker secrets, and set `RAILWAY_URL` or `BACKEND_URL` to your public VexoStream Core backend. The site is deployed manually with Wrangler. For a release artifact from GitHub Actions, use the repository secret `APP_KEY`, or build locally with `--dart-define=APP_KEY=...`. Never commit any of these values. The app key is embedded in the desktop binary, so it is a client gate, not a secret from a determined user.

The Worker serves `vexostream.bond/*`, `www.vexostream.bond/*`, and `api.vexostream.bond/*` through Cloudflare zone routes. The API uses a Worker Route, not a Custom Domain. Routes require an existing proxied DNS record for `api` in the `vexostream.bond` zone; Wrangler does not create that DNS record or a separate certificate. The API hostname returns plain 404s for `/` and website paths. `/api/v1` and image requests require `X-App-Key`; signed media proxy URLs use short-lived IP-bound signatures for native HLS playback. The app login accepts member and Owner credentials. The app Owner dashboard covers the site Admin sections for providers, backend, members, team, social, Telegram, live viewers, operations, and password management. App model filters are translated into the Core API’s `Female`, `Female,Male`, and `Male` values.
